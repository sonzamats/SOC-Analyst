# SOC SIEM Implementation

This repository contains a complete Security Operations Center (SOC) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution using the Elastic Stack.

## Components

- **Elasticsearch**: For storing and searching security logs and events
- **Kibana**: For visualization and dashboard creation
- **Logstash**: For log processing and normalization
- **Filebeat**: For log collection

## Quick Start

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the stack
4. Access Kibana at http://localhost:5601 (credentials: elastic/changeme)

## Setup Instructions

1. Create an index pattern in Kibana:
   - Go to Stack Management â†’ Index Patterns
   - Create new pattern `logstash-*`
   - Select `@timestamp` as the time field

2. Explore the data:
   - Go to Discover tab to search logs
   - Create visualizations for security metrics
   - Build dashboards for monitoring

## Sample Logs

The repository includes sample security logs for testing. Add your own logs to the `logs/` directory to have them processed by the system.

## Security Features

- Preconfigured log parsing for common security events
- Alert capability for suspicious activities
- Dashboards for security monitoring
- Integration with threat intelligence feeds

## Customizing

- Modify Logstash pipelines in `logstash/pipeline/` to adapt to your log formats
- Adjust Filebeat configuration to collect logs from different sources
- Create custom dashboards based on your security requirements
